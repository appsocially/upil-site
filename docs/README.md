# UPIL: User Page Interaction Language
UPIL is a language and framework designed to make writing applications with lots of interaction with a user - especially chatbots - as easy as possible.

A UPIL scenario describes a set of steps that an application will move through. It allows you to ask the user for information, and then use that information later to decide which step to take, or for personalizing the user-interaction.
